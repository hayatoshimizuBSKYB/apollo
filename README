Apollo is a collection of applications that allows application / system logs to be stored in Cassandra (http://cassandra.apache.org).

We aim to provide the following;

- Log collection and storage of logs into cassandra
- Log viewer
- Real-time analytics of logs

This is a project started in Sky Software Engineering (http://www.sky.com).
